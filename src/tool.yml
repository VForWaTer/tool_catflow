      title: Create a CATFLOW geometry file from .tif files using the method of representative hillslopes (Loritz et al 2017).
      description: |
        Hillslope wizard developed by Ralf Loritz (2015)
        Delination of 2D catenas from hillslopes. The idea behind this code is based on a approach from Francke et al. 2006 (Automated 
        catena-based discretization of landscapes for the derivation of hydrological modelling 
        units) and Cochrane and Flanagan (2003). The idea behind this approach is to select every unique distance and their corrosponding 
        elevation from a river inside a hillslope. If more than one raster cell have the same 
        distance the elevation is calculated by a weighted mean using the flow accumulation. The 
        hillslope width can be estimated by the frequency of the appearance of a single distance. 
        In this present version, we assume a fixed horizontal and varying vertical grid spacing for the hillslope element as in Manoj J et al (2024). This would be revised in the
        upcoming versions.
      parameters:
        hillslope_id:
          type: integer
          description: Integer ID of the hillsope from hillslope.tif for calculating the geometry. If entire basin is to be used for the representative hillslope, give -1.
          default: -1
        no_flow_area:
          type: float
          description: |
           Percentage of no flow area  with almost no slope within the area of interest. 
           The idea is to identify a part of the upper hillslope that has consistently very low estimated width (below the no_rf quantile) 
           and might be considered a "no flow" or contributing only minimally to runoff. By shortening the profile, the tool might focus on the more 
           hydrologically active lower part of the hillslope.
          default: 0.30  
        min_cells:
          type: integer
          description: |
           Minimum number of unique number of unique rounded distance values to be considered for the hillslope geometry.
           This parameter helps to filter out very short or simple hillslopes that might not be well-represented by the 2D catena approach,
            potentially due to insufficient variation in distance and elevation.
          default: 10
        hill_type:
          type: enum
          description: |
            Hillslope type. (1) constant thickness (default), (2) cake-shape, (3) variable thickness with spline approximation of lower boundary. 
            Refer CATFLOW manual for more details.
          values:
            - constant
            - cake
            - variable
          default: constant
        depth:
          type: float
          description: thickness of soil profile
          default: 2.1
        constant_width:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            If true, use a constant width for the hillslope geometry. If false, use varying width for the hillslope geometry.
          default: true
        min_area:
          type: integer
          description: |
            Minimum area (in square meters) required for a hillslope to be considered valid.
          default: 10000
        freedom:
          type: integer
          description: |
            Degree of freedom for the spline function used in hillslope geometry calculations.
          default: 10
